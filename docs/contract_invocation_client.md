# SDK Soroban Contract Invocation Client

PocketPay's `createContractClient` is a reusable, typed entry point for
contract reads and signed state-changing calls. It validates the contract ID,
optionally checks the supported method schema, simulates every call, and maps
simulation/confirmation outcomes into stable SDK results.

## Read-only versus signed calls

Use `client.readOnly({ method, params, sourcePublicKey })` to simulate a
view method. Reads do **not** sign, submit or consume a sequence number.

Use `client.invoke({ method, params, signWith })` only for a method declared
as `kind: 'invoke'`. It simulates, assembles, signs and submits the transaction,
then queries Soroban RPC for finality. Neither API discovers arbitrary contract
methods: provide a supported method schema to reject missing/wrong-kind calls
before any network or signing step.

```ts
import { createContractClient } from '@stellar-pocketpay/sdk';

const client = createContractClient({
  contractId, // deployed, trusted C... contract ID
  methods: {
    get_balance: { kind: 'readOnly', paramTypes: { user: 'address' } },
    deposit: {
      kind: 'invoke',
      paramTypes: { user: 'address', amount: 'i128' },
    },
  },
});

const balance = await client.readOnly({
  method: 'get_balance',
  params: { user: publicKey },
  sourcePublicKey: publicKey,
});

const receipt = await client.invoke({
  method: 'deposit',
  params: { user: publicKey, amount: amountInStroops },
  signWith: sourceSecretKey,
});
```

Supply the private key only to the signing call, never to `params` or an
RPC diagnostic. Select a contract ID deployed on the same trusted network
configured for the SDK.

## Confirmation and unknown outcomes

A submitted Soroban transaction is **not** necessarily failed when its first
RPC `getTransaction(hash)` lookup returns `NOT_FOUND`. Both the reusable
client and the legacy `depositToVault` / `withdrawFromVault` helpers apply
one overall confirmation budget (the resolved `SDKConfig.timeout`, normally
30 seconds), waiting up to one second between lookups. Each lookup uses
only the budget remaining; an additional attempt bound guards unusual clocks.

| Observed result | Client outcome | Next action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| RPC `SUCCESS` | `success: true`, `status: 'success'` | Safe to treat as confirmed |
| RPC `FAILED` | `success: false`, `status: 'failed'` | Inspect error and the submitted hash |
| Repeated `NOT_FOUND`, exhausted budget, lookup failure or unexpected status | `success: false`, `status: 'pending'`, `errorCode: 'TX_STATUS_UNKNOWN'` | Query the original hash again later |
| Simulation failed before submission | `success: false` with a simulation error | No submission was made |

A pending/unknown result includes the original submitted `hash` whenever the
RPC accepted the transaction and returned one. A generic submission timeout
is also an unknown outcome, but may happen before the SDK receives a hash.

```ts
if (!receipt.success && receipt.status === 'pending') {
  // Do not build, sign or submit a second transfer here.
  // Persist receipt.hash (if present), display an unconfirmed state, and
  // query the same network's transaction status again before any retry.
}
```

There is no automatic submission retry in either Soroban confirmation path.
Do not convert an unknown confirmation into a failed payment or a zero balance.
A response `status: 'failed'` requires actual RPC `FAILED` finality, not a
poll timeout.

The unit cases in `tests/contract-client-factory.test.ts` cover method
validation, read-only signing separation, success and simulation errors;
`tests/soroban-finality-polling.test.ts` covers terminal responses and
bounded/unknown confirmation behavior. Those tests are independent of live RPC.
