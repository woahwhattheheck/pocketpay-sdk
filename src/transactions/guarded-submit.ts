 * Stage 4 — submit through the duplicate-submission guard, preserving the

 * This is what the one-shot payment helpers use. It differs from
 * the orchestrator's `submitGuarded` in two ways that matter to them:
 *
 * 1. The raw submission carries `cfg.timeout`, which
 *    `submitTransactionIdempotently` does not apply to its own network call.
 * 2. A **definitive** rejection re-throws the *original* Horizon error, so the
 *    helper's existing result-code mapping still runs. The guard changes when
 *    the SDK gives up, not which error code a rejected transaction produces.
 *
 * Only the unknown-status case is intercepted: there the envelope may already
 * be on-chain, so the SDK polls instead of surfacing a failure the caller might
 * "fix" by paying twice.
 *
 * @param transaction - A signed envelope.
 * @param options - Polling budget for the unknown-status path.
 * @param config - Optional SDK config overrides.
 * @returns The Horizon response, either from the submission or from polling.
 * @throws The original submission error when the rejection is definitive.
